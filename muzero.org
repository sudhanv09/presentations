* History
** Go
Go is known as the most challenging classical game for artificial intelligence because of its complexity. There are more than 10 ^ 170 different positions.

** AlphaGo
AlphaGo was the first computer program to play Go well enough to beat the world's leading champion.

** How does AlphaGo solve it?
AlphaGo is based on combination of a Deep Neural Network and MCTS
It has three components:

- Policy Network
- Value Network
- Tree Search
