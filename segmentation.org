#+OPTIONS: date:nil toc:1

* Introduction
** Objective
+ Drone Landing needs the area to be clear
+ Detecting obstacles near the landing zone is important
+ Segmentation is used to get pixel level detection

** Architecture
+ UNet is used for segmentation task
+ MobilNet is used for feature detection

* Data
+ Dataset sourced from kaggle
+ Dataset contains 400 images and mask pairs
+ Preprocessing techniques like horizontal and vertical flip, random brightness, gaussian noise
+ Divided into 306 train, 54 val and 40 test images.

* Training
+ Training for 12 epochs
+ Validation after each training epoch

* Evaluation
+ Pixel accuracy
+ MIoU because pixel accuracy can be decieving.

* Results
** Test 1
